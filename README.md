# Network Topology Simulator

Network Topology Simulator is an interactive web-based tool for designing and analyzing computer networks. It allows users to create nodes, connect them with weighted edges, and visualize shortest paths using Dijkstra’s algorithm.

## 🚀 Features

- **Add Nodes** – Click to create draggable nodes on the canvas.
- **Delete Nodes** – Remove nodes and associated edges from the network.
- **Preset Layouts** – Automatically arrange nodes in common formats like ring or star.
- **Connect Nodes** – Draw edges between nodes to represent connections.
- **Edge Weighting** – Assign custom weights to edges for cost or distance simulation.
- **Node Renaming** – Rename nodes for easier identification.
- **Message Animation** – Visualize data flow from one node to another.
- **Shortest Path Finder** – Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the most efficient route.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Layout and structure of the interface.
- **CSS** – Styling of canvas, nodes, and UI elements.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – Core logic, interactivity, and algorithm implementation.
